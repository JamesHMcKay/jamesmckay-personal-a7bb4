## Credentials

I have a PhD in physics from Imperial College London. I also recieved a Masters and an undergraduate Honours degree from the University of Canterbury with majors in Mathematics and Physics. I have worked as a product development engineer, software developer and data analyst.

With over 10 years experience solving complex problems I am confident in solving new and unique problems in any context.

## Accessible solutions

Robust solutions make sense. I understand the importance of communicating solutions to all parts of a business and their customers, and enjoy stripping away technical jargon so that anyone with the business knoweldge can be part of the problem solving process.
