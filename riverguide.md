The New Zealand RiverGuide was developed to provide live environmental data alongside recreational guides for activities in New Zealand freshwater.

The RiverGuide is the only website that presents live river flow and rainfall gauges from all New Zealand regional councils in one place. This collection of data from 15 different sources is  delievered using a custom built backend service, the [RiverService](https://github.com/JamesHMcKay/RiverService). This application is effectively a high performance data pipeline, it automatically collects live data, cleans the data and makes it consistent. This service makes all New Zealand's rainfall and flow data available through a REST API for the RiverGuide to display in a user friendly way.
