        subtitle: Extracting value from data
        content: >
          I create insights by following a proven approach to data analysis. The
          first step is data cleaning; understanding what parts of the data hold
          value and bringing together data from a range of places. This is often
          the hardest part and requires care, and can involve many levels of
          automation. Once a robust, repeatable data cleaning process is in
          place I can produce valuable insights with confidence. Depending on
          the business problem this can involve using the appropriate
          statistical methodology to extract further information from the data,
          or find the right visualisations to make results easy to understand.

        content: >-
          Automation saves time and reduces errors. Almost every task is worth
          automating to some extent. Using the appropriate tools I automate
          process, from simple file management tasks through to large data
          pipelines.
