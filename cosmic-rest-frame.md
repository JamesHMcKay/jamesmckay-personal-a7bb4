*Before the 16th century the notion that our civilistion was not fixed at centre of the universe was preposterous. With the progress of astronomy the more familiar concept of the Earth moving in space soon overtook this geocentric view. With the question resolved in our own solar system, we now face similar questions on a cosmological scale. The notion of cosmological rest and the consequent assumptions involved have implications throughout observational cosmology. Is any observer truly at rest in our vast and dynamic universe, and if so, who?*

\- J.H. McKay 2015 M.Sc. thesis.

For my Master research I extended work by Wiltshire et al. on the definition of a cosmic rest frame. Using a sample of 4,534 galaxies we performed an optimisation to find the reference frame that minimised the monopole variation of the spherically averaged non-linear Hubble expansion. This analysis ruled out the cosmic microwave background (CMB) rest frame as the frame with the most uniform Hubble expansion. However, the frame of reference defined by the Local Group of galaxies, was within our set of candidate rest frames.

The figure below is a sample from the published work. The values of fp close to 0 indicate a frame of reference that removes the what can be considered a systematic variation in the Hubble expansion variation seen in the CMB reference frame, the black cross is the boost to the Local Group frame, while the white cross is the boost to the frame with the minimum Hubble expansion variation. The fact that these align with the region of fp close to unity further suggests the Hubble expansion variation seen in the CMB frame is of a systematic origin due to the frame of reference itself. See the publication (below) for more details.

The research was further extended using a sample of 8,162 galaxies. After statistical bias was identified and treated we were able to achieve comparable results with our other data set, consistent with the CMB frame being ruled out as the frame of minimum Hubble expansion variation.

**Defining the frame of minimum non-linear Hubble expansion variation** was published in the *Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society*, Volume 457, Issue 3, 11 April 2016, Pages 3285â€“3305 <https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stw128>.
