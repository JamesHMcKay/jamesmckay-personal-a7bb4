      - title: What is your process?
        content: >
          When working in a new domain I like to get a physical view of the data
          and processes that currently exist. From there I picture the end goal.
          While solutions can often be abstract ideas, and remain that way for
          too long, I like to deliver something early. For me getting a
          prototype product up fast is key. It won't be perfect to begin with,
          nor will it solve all the problems, but it allows for fast iterations
          and rapid improvements. I repeat this process until the final product
          is built, tested and ready to go.
      - title: What technology do you work with?
        content: >
          I have over 10 years experience working with many different technology
          stacks. Software is about applying logic and patterns to solve
          problems, the language used is simply a way of expressing these
          patterns. I generally try and use the right tool for the job, keeping
          in mind the environment in which I'm working, the data and the
          requirements.
      - title: What if my business is technical?
        content: >-
          No product or service is too technical to learn and understand. Part
          of our initial onboarding is an in-depth understanding of your
          offerings, your target audience and your level of technical writing
          needed.
      - title: How fast can we get started?
        content: >-
          The onboarding process typically lasts 3-4 days and consists of an
          intro video call, an interview, a questionnaire and some back and
          forth communication for technical purposes. After that, we can go as
          fast as you need.
      - title: Who handles the design?
        content: >-
          You can choose to provide the design yourself, or I can include a
          design element to your proposal. I work with several wonderful
          designers with ample experience in web, digital, campaign and
          marketing design.
