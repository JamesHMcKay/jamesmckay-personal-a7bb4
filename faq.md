      - title: What is your process?
        content: >
          When working in a new domain I like to get a physical view of the data
          and processes that currently exist. From there I try and picture the
          end goal of the product I going to build. While solutions can often be
          abstract ideas, and remain that way for too long, I like to deliver
          something early. For me getting a prototype product up fast is key. It
          won't be perfect to begin with, but it allows for fast iterations and
          rapid improvements. I repeat this process until the final product is
          built, tested and ready to go.
      - title: Can you manage our social media?
        content: >-
          Of course! I am happy to manage Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook
          and any other social media platform you wish to maintain. This
          includes both posting relevant and interesting content, and replying
          to questions and comments from your audience.
      - title: How do you base your pricing?
        content: >-
          Depending on the scope and timeline of your content needs, we can work
          on a retainer basis, an hour bank, or a per-project basis. Once I
          understand your needs I will create a tailored proposal with several
          options to choose from.
      - title: What if my business is technical?
        content: >-
          No product or service is too technical to learn and understand. Part
          of our initial onboarding is an in-depth understanding of your
          offerings, your target audience and your level of technical writing
          needed.
      - title: How fast can we get started?
        content: >-
          The onboarding process typically lasts 3-4 days and consists of an
          intro video call, an interview, a questionnaire and some back and
          forth communication for technical purposes. After that, we can go as
          fast as you need.
      - title: Who handles the design?
        content: >-
          You can choose to provide the design yourself, or I can include a
          design element to your proposal. I work with several wonderful
          designers with ample experience in web, digital, campaign and
          marketing design.
