As New Zealand entered a lock down to prevent the spread of COVID-19 there was a need from both the public and private sectors for accessible, up to date data. With so many data sets available, and coming in fast, there was a need to produce something to get data out as quickly as possible.

With a technology stack limited to R and the Shiny dashboard package, I developed a solution for data ingestion and standardisation through to presentation in a consistent, clean format. From an initial dozen indicators, we scaled to hundreds over the months during and after the New Zealand lock down. At the time of writing the product is still in operation a year on.
